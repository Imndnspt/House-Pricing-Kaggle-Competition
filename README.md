# House-Pricing-Kaggle-Competition
This notebook is the same as the one I use in House Pricing Competition in Kaggle. It is my first trial in the competition and I'm gonna try to build another model later to get a better result. As the name of the competition suggest, here I build models to predict sales price of houses using linear regression and random forest. Using those two model, I evaluate the model using train dataset by calculating RMSE. Lastly, from the submission, I reduce RMSE from 0.62987 from linear regressino model to 0.19406 from random forest model.
